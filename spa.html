                <p>Touching is healing; from a mother's touch which comforts and soothes her baby to the
                     triumphant athlete patted on the back by fellow athletes. Based on the same principle 
                     as human touch, massage is the oldest method of promoting good health, suppleness and 
                     strength. Today, the role of massage therapy is recognized by the general public and 
                     other health care professionals as being an effective health care alternative. </p>

            <p>It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a family emergency and we 
                understand it is extremely disappointing to not have the treatment you requested. 
                Staff will make every effort to find an alternative time in the day or during your stay with 
                another therapist, sometimes involving a slightly different Treatment. We appreciate our 
                guests for being so patient during these unforeseen circumstances. Currently, if there is a 
                cancellation and you cannot be accommodated, there will be no Spa charge to your room.
                A Free Voucher for a 1 hour (Not RMT) Spa Treatment will now be provided for your next
                getaway at the Couples Resort.
                </p>

                 <p>The Policy change allows us not only to make sure there is no out-of-pocket
                     expense (the cost of the treatment) but that we will also compensate you beyond 
                     what the Couples Resort could not provide you.
